# Rust

Generally it's recommended to follow the [Rust API Guidelines].

[Rust API Guidelines]:https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html

## Module hierarchy

Using `mod.rs` files is preferred to the `directory.rs` hierarchy schema.

`mod.rs` hierarchy:
```
foo/
    bar.rs
    mod.rs
```
`directory.rs` hierarchy:
```
foo/
    bar.rs
foo.rs
```
Directories containing only a `mod.rs` file should be not be used.

## Doc comments
Please refer to the [Rust standard library documentation convention].

Since documentation cannot be verified by the compiler, doctests are an important part of documentation.
They enforce adapting documentation in sync with the code.

Also see the [general Markdown guidelines](./markdown.md).

## Safety comments

All unsafe code should have an attached safety comment describing why it is safe within the context.
This is enforced via the [`clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks`](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#undocumented_unsafe_blocks) lint.
The `SAFETY:` prefix should be all-caps, but this is not checked by the lint.

Related are `# Safety` sections mentioned in the above documentation convention, these should be applied to functions that are unsafe-to-call, describing what pre-conditions must be followed to make calling the API safe.

### Panic and error messages

>The error message given by the Display representation of an error type should be lowercase without trailing punctuation, and typically concise.

For consistency within our codebase and with the Rust API guidelines, all error and panic messages should follow the Rust API guidelines.

### Bounds

Rust allows specifying bounds inline (`impl <T: Foo> Bar<T>`) and via `where` (`impl <T> Bar<T> where T: Foo`).
Using inline notation does not scale very well beyond anything other than trivial cases:

```rust
fn foo<A: Sized, B: Serialize + Deserialize, C: Sized + 'static>(_: A, _: B, _: C) {
    //...
}

// vs

fn foo<A, B, C>(_: A, _: B, _: C)
where
    A: Sized,
    B: Serialize + Deserialize,
    C: Sized + 'static
{
    //...
}

```

Objectively deciding what constitutes "trivial" is impossible, thus `where` notation should be used for any bounds.

## Dependencies

All dependencies should be specified at the workspace level with `default-features = false`, then referenced via `workspace = true` in crates with any needed features.
For consistency, we use the inline-table syntax for both, the workspace and crate level.

```toml
# Workspace:
[workspace.dependencies]
awesome = { version = "1.3.5", default-features = false}

# Crate in workspace with no features:
[dependencies]
awesome = { workspace = true }

# Crate in workspace with features:
[dependencies]
awesome = { workspace = true, features = ["secure-password", "civet"]}

# Stand-alone crate:
[dependencies]
awesome = { version = "1.3.5", default-features = false, features = ["secure-password", "civet"]}
```
